# ***Project Step - 1 Scanner***
## ***Due Date: September 6, 2017***

### ***What needs to be done***
The first real step of the building the project is build a Scanner

#### ***What is a Scanner ?***
A scanner is an implementation of a deterministic finite automaton (DFA, Finite State Machine).

Which means that the scanner only loops through the whole code (recursion is not allowed)

#### ***Job of Scanner***

<p>In simple terms, The Job of the scanner is to scan the code written by the user and analyze the lexical abnormalities in the code. Hence, the Scanner can also be called as a Lexical Analyzer </p>

<p>It's main task is to read the input characters (or code) and produce a sequence of tokens that in turn will be used by the Syntax Analyzer. Scanner is generally implemented as a subroutine, which is utilized by the syntax analyzer as needed i.e. whenever it wants a next token. </p>

<p>Secondary Task is to ignore the whitespaces (such as spaces, tabs and newline character in the source) and comments.Another task is to keep track of the line numbers so meaningful error messages can be generated</p>
